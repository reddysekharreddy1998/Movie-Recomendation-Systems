1.Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this movie recommender system is derived from the MovieLens dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for collaborative filtering and recommendation system research. It consists of two primary tables: ratings and movie titles.
1. Ratings Dataset
The ratings dataset contains user interactions with movies, represented by explicit ratings. Each row in this dataset corresponds to a single rating provided by a user for a specific movie. The dataset consists of the following columns:
•	user_id: A unique identifier for each user.
•	item_id: A unique identifier corresponding to a movie.
•	ratings: A numerical rating given by the user to the movie, typically on a scale of 1 to 5.
•	timestamp: A Unix timestamp indicating when the rating was given.
2. Movie Titles Dataset
The movie titles dataset provides metadata about movies, allowing for easier interpretation of the recommendations. It includes:
•	item_id: The unique identifier matching the movie in the ratings dataset.
•	title: The name of the movie along with its release year.




2.Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to users using two approaches:
1.	Popularity-Based Recommendations: Suggest movies with the highest average ratings and significant user engagement.
2.	Collaborative Filtering: Recommend movies based on patterns in user-item interactions, leveraging similarities between users or items.
